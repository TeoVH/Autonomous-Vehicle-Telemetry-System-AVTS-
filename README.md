# Autonomous Vehicle Telemetry System (AVTS)

The **Autonomous Vehicle Telemetry System (AVTS)** is a client-server project designed to simulate real-time telemetry for an autonomous vehicle.  
It was developed as an academic project to practice **network programming, concurrency, authentication, and GUI development**.

- **Server**: Implemented in C using Berkeley sockets and pthreads.
- **Clients**: Implemented in Python (Tkinter) and Java (Swing/JavaFX).
- **Protocol**: Custom text-based protocol with authentication, telemetry broadcast, and role-based commands.

The system simulates an autonomous vehicle that:
- **Transmits telemetry data** every 10 seconds to all connected users
- **Receives control commands** from authenticated administrators
- **Manages user authentication** with role-based access control
- **Logs all activities** for audit and debugging purposes

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Server**: Implemented in C using Berkeley sockets and pthreads
- **Protocol**: Custom text-based protocol with authentication and telemetry broadcast
- **Concurrency**: Multi-threaded server supporting up to 100 simultaneous clients
- **Security**: Role-based authentication with login attempt limiting
- **Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail with user action tracking

## üë• User Roles

### **Administrator (ADMIN)**
- Can send control commands to the vehicle
- Can request vehicle status
- Full access to all system functions
- Commands: `SPEED UP`, `TURN LEFT`, `TURN RIGHT`, `BATTERY RESET`, `STATUS`

### **Observer (OBSERVER)**
- Receives telemetry data broadcasts
- Can request vehicle status
- Read-only access to vehicle information
- Commands: `STATUS` only

## üöÄ Build & Run Instructions

### 1. Build the server
The server is written in C and requires `gcc`, `pthread`, and `libssl-dev`.  
From the project root:

```bash
make
```
This will produce an executable named `server`.

### 2. Run the server

```bash
./server <port> <log_file>
```

**Example:**
```bash
./server 5050 log.txt
```

- The server will listen on the specified port
- Logs will be written both to the console and the log file
- Telemetry data is broadcast every 10 seconds

### 3. Connect a client
During development, you can use **netcat (nc)** to test the protocol:

```bash
nc 127.0.0.1 5050
```

## üîê Authentication

### Login as Administrator:
```bash
LOGIN ADMIN root password
```

### Login as Observer:
```bash
LOGIN OBSERVER juan 12345
```

## üì° Protocol Commands

### **Administrator Commands:**
```bash
SPEED UP          # Increase vehicle speed
TURN LEFT         # Turn vehicle left
TURN RIGHT        # Turn vehicle right
BATTERY RESET     # Reset battery to 100%
STATUS            # Get current vehicle status
```

### **Observer Commands:**
```bash
STATUS            # Get current vehicle status
```

### **Server Responses:**
```bash
OK\n              # Command executed successfully
ERR locked\n      # Account locked after 3 failed attempts
ERR invalid (1/3)\n # Invalid credentials (shows attempt count)
ERR observer_only\n # Observer tried to use admin command
ERR unknown_cmd\n   # Unknown command
```

## üìä Telemetry Data Format

The server broadcasts telemetry data every 10 seconds in the format:
```
DATA <speed> <battery> <direction> <temperature>
```

**Example:**
```
DATA 75.5 85 FORWARD 28.3
```

- **speed**: Vehicle speed (0-100 + offset)
- **battery**: Battery level (0-100, decreases 5% every 10s)
- **direction**: FORWARD, LEFT, RIGHT
- **temperature**: Temperature in Celsius (20-40¬∞C simulated)

## üìù Logging System

The system provides comprehensive logging with three types of entries:

### **1. Connection Events:**
```
[2025-09-28T12:30:45] CONNECTION [CONNECT] [unknown:NONE] from 127.0.0.1:39204
[2025-09-28T12:30:50] CONNECTION [LOGIN_SUCCESS] [root:ADMIN] from 127.0.0.1:39204
[2025-09-28T12:31:10] CONNECTION [DISCONNECT] [root:ADMIN] from 127.0.0.1:39204
```

### **2. User Actions:**
```
[2025-09-28T12:30:55] USER_ACTION [root:ADMIN] SPEED UP: speed_offset increased
[2025-09-28T12:31:00] USER_ACTION [root:ADMIN] TURN LEFT: direction changed to LEFT
[2025-09-28T12:31:05] USER_ACTION [root:ADMIN] STATUS: requested vehicle status
```

### **3. Telemetry Broadcasts:**
```
[2025-09-28T12:31:10] Broadcast DATA: DATA 75.5 85 FORWARD 28.3
```

## üîí Security Features

- **Login Attempt Limiting**: Account locked after 3 failed attempts for 5 minutes
- **Role-based Access Control**: Different permissions for ADMIN vs OBSERVER
- **Secure Authentication**: Username/password validation
- **Connection Tracking**: All connections and disconnections logged
- **Action Auditing**: Every user action is logged with timestamp and details
